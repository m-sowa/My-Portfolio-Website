:bulb: I created my Portfolio Website for two main reasons:
* to practice basic HMTL and CSS,
* to present my roadmap for the journey to become a software tester.

:monocle_face: The aim was to create a simple website that would allow me to practice:
* using the essentials of HTML/CSS syntax,
* styling different types of HTML elements with CSS properties,
* using different layout modules (flexbox, grid),
* using media query to improve responsiveness.

:muscle: I'm planning to keep updating the website with every new testing-related skill or portion of knowledge that I acquire.
