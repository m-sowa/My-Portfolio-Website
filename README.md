# My Portfolio Website

:sunglasses: Since a standard resume format is not meant to include a lot of detailed information, I decided to create my portfolio website that would allow me to present my "becoming-a-software-tester" project more fully.

## My aim
:bulb: I created my Portfolio Website for two main reasons:
* to practice the basics of HTML and CSS,
* to present my roadmap for the journey to become a software tester.

## Skills practiced
:monocle_face: The aim was to create a simple website that would allow me to practice:
* using the essentials of HTML/CSS syntax,
* styling different types of HTML elements with CSS properties,
* using different layout modules (flexbox, grid),
* using media query to improve responsiveness.

:muscle: I'll keep learning and updating the website accordingly!
